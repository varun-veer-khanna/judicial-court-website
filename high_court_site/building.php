      <p>
      Designed by Le Corbusier, a French Architect, the High Court has got a beautiful building. Apart from the Court rooms, it houses the Offices of many Administrative Branches such as Registrar's Office, Establishment Branch, Gazette Branch and Copying Branch etc. The Offices of Advocate-Generals, Punjab and Haryana also adjoin the main building. </p>

      <p>The High Court is a linear block with the main facade toward the piazza. It has a rhythmic arcade created by a parasol-like roof, which shades the entire building. Keeping in view the special dignity of the judges, Le Corbusier created a special entrance for them through a high portico resting on three giant pylons painted in bright colours.Very much in the tradition of the Buland Darwaza of Fatehpur-Sikri, this grand entrance with its awesome scale, is intended to manifest the Majesty of the Law to all who enter. Juxtaposed between the main courtroom of the Chief Justice and eight smaller courts, is a great entrance hall. Its scale--especially the height -- is experienced most intensely while walking up the ramp. The symbolism of providing an "umbrella of shelter" of law to the ordinary citizen is most vividly manifested here. The continuity of the concrete piazza running into this space establishes a unique site and structural unity of the structure with the ground plane.The massive concrete pylons representing again the "Majesty of Law" are painted in bright primary colours and visually punctuate the otherwise rhythmic facade of the High Court. The rear side of this ceremonial entrance for the judges is a working entrance and a large car park at a sunken level. The massive piers and the blank end walls have interesting cut-outs and niches, to establish a playful connection with the human scale.</p>
      <h2>Tapestries</h2>
<p>Colourful tapestries, one to each courtroom, cover the entire rear wall -- 12 metres square in the main courtroom and 8 metres square for the smaller courtrooms. A number of symbols that encapsulated Le Corbusier's view of man, earth, nature, the emblems of India and the scales of justice were depicted in abstract, geometric patches. They were also required for acoustical reasons.</p>

<p>These tapestry designs referred to the architectural plan, in particular Le Corbusier's exaltation of the right angle asbasic element of architecture, and of order generally. The designs are based on Le Corbusier's Modular, which he used to organise the entire Capitol Complex and give dimensions to all its buildings. He described the Modular as "a modest servant offered by mathematics to people desirous of harmony, a universal tool for all kinds of fabrications destined to be sent to all parts of the world. Furthermore, it solves by the decimal system the inextricable manipulation of the inch-foot system, an ancestral and totally respectable measure. The Modular is based on human height ... it places man at the centre of the drama, its solar plexus being the key to the three measures, which express the occupation of space by its members."

The High Court was the first building to be made wholly of concrete. A sum of Rs 40 lacs was spent on its construction. The commendable success for the completion of the building by the target date was entirely due to the able administration of Sh P L Verma, Chief High Court building under construction Engineer and Secretary Capital Project and his assistantMr R C Singh, Executive Engineer. The construction of this unique building, which opened a new phase for concrete construction, was done by Messrs Hindustan Construction Corporation Ltd. Bombay under the supervision of Sh K C Iyya. It is one of the most beautiful High Courts in India with 40 spacious and luxuriously furnished courtrooms; 3 Bar rooms; a well-equipped Judges' library, a dispensary and a very good canteen. Its location in the lap of Himalayas beyond the limits of the city, beside Assembly Hall and Sukhna Lake adds to its beauty.</p>
